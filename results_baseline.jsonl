The function fibonacci_recursive(n) calculates the nth Fibonacci number by recursively calling itself with arguments n-1 and n-2. The recursive calls are made until the base case is reached, i.e., n <= 1. The base case is implemented by returning the value of n if n is less than or equal to 1. Otherwise, the recursive calls are made and the result is returned.\n\nThe problem with this implementation is that it suffers from the problem of exponential time complexity. The time complexity of the function is O(2^n). This means that the running time of the function increases exponentially with the increase in the value of n. For example, if n = 10, the function will make 2^10 = 1024 recursive calls, which is a lot. This can cause the function to take a lot of time to execute.\n\nTo improve the performance of this function, we can use dynamic programming.
